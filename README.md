For this project, I am developing a simple online food ordering and management system in PHP. The goal is to create a platform that allows users to conveniently order food online without having to visit the store in person. 
This system is designed to be managed by an administrator who can create dishes, set prices, and upload images. Users can browse the menu, view top dishes, and select their preferred restaurants from the home page. 
This project aims to enhance the food ordering experience for users and streamline the management process for restaurant administrators.
